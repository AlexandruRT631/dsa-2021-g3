Data Structures and Algorithms lab repository


## Structure


### Lab 1

Introduction to GIT and the work-flow of the lab + starting with Singly Linked Lists

### Lab 2
Circular Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists (+ Introduction to complexity)

### Lab 3
Test 1 - Lists

### Lab 4

Trees - more precisely, Binary Trees, Balanced Binary Trees (the theory)

### Lab 5

Binary Search Trees


### Lab 6
Test 2 - Trees

### Lab 7
Graphs - representation and traversals

### Lab 8
Graphs - Graph Processing Algorithms (Dijkstra, Prim, Kursal, Floyd etc.)

### Lab 9
Test 3 - Graphs

### Lab 10
Hash Tables - introduction, collision detection, usages

### Lab 11
Sorting Algorithms - Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick, Radix.

### Lab 12
Test 4 - Sorting Algorithms & Hash Tables

### Lab 13 
Exam problem practice

## Grading


### Administrative

* Max number of absences = 1 (NOT applicable for test days - if you miss a test day, you'll have to take the test separately, problem will be more difficult)
* Assignments will be given dynamic feedback through GIT and will be graded only after one says he/she is thoroughly done with it.
* Only assignments which are pushed to GIT will be graded and taken into consideration.
* "Extra credit" assignments can only be completed by those who already have completed the 'normal' assignments. They will be even more thoroughly inspected and evaluated.

### About tests

* Grades range: 1-10
* Code does not even compile: 1 (by default, no excuses)
* For every warning: -0.25 on the grade - your code should be clean enough to surpass any Codeblocks/CLion warnings
* Cheating attempts: 1 (by default, no excuses)
